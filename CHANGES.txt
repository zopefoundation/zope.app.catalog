============================
Changes for zope.app.catalog
============================


2007/09/27 3.5.0a3:
===================

- removed some deprecations


2007/09/21 3.5.0a2:
===================

- bugfix: passing the context to getAllUtilitiesRegisteredFor in all
  eventhandlers because no catalog was found which was located in a
  sub site and for example the ObjectModifiesEvent get fired from somewhere
  in the root.


2007/06/26 3.5.0a1:
===================

- Added marker interfaces to prevent automatic indexing (see:
  event.txt)
